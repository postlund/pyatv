## 0.4.0a13 (2020-01-31)

*Changes:*

* Fixed bug where device state would be reported as "paused"
  when playing (yielding incorrect position as side-effect). This
  also fixes delta updates, where metadata would sometimes be
  lost.
* Fixed bug where a crash would occur if a device had a = (0x3D)
  in its MAC-address
* Added artwork_id to metadata that gives a unique id for artwork
* Use cache for artwork that saves the latest four artworks
* Identifiers in config is now prioritized in order
  MRP, DMAP and AirPlay
* AirPlay is not handled specially in config now. If no AirPlay
  service is added, no service will be implicitly created.
* Error handling (raised exceptions) are now more consistent
  when pairing

*Breaking changes*

* AirPlay interface has been renamed to "stream", e.g. use
  atv.stream.play_url instead of atv.airplay.play_url.

*Notes:*

* Running tests on Windows works again
* This release contains a lot new test coverage and all "common"
  functional tests have been ported to MRP
