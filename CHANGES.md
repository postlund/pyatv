## 0.9.1 Lolbit (2021-09-23)

Minor bug fix release coming up! Should fix connection issues when a stale
MRP service is present after upgrading to tvOS 15. Also improves pairing requirement
handling for AirPlay and RAOP in case access control is set to "Only devices in
my home" (will now report as Disabled). Companion is also reported as Unsupported
for HomePods as pyatv cannot pair with them.

A new convert method to convert a `DeviceModel` to string has been added.

**Changes:**

*Protocol: AirPlay:*

```
2558a89 airplay: Support Disabled pairing requirement
```

*Protocol: Companion:*

```
6cb7269 companion: Better support for pairing requirement
```

```
d257378 raop: Support Disabled pairing requirement
```

## 0.9.0 JayJay (2021-09-22)

So, what's new? Yeah, right, tvOS 15 was released the day before yesterday
which broke everything. My intention was to release 0.9.0 before tvOS 15
dropped, but things kept popping up and I had no choice but to delay. So here
we are.

The biggest feature in this release is obviously support for tvOS 15. Perhaps
not the most exciting feature per se, but important as most of the
functionality in pyatv is lost without it. The gist is that Apple decided to
drop support for the MRP protocol introduced in tvOS. In practice they didn't
get rid or it, they just allocated a special stream type in AirPlay (2) and
decided to tunnel MRP over it. So MRP is still there, it's just carried over
AirPlay now. As far as I know, this is how they have done it the last couple of
iOS/tvOS releases. So it's not really new, just something no one looked into.
The deprecation of the "regular" MRP protocol is reasonable (who uses the
Remote app nowadays?), so I don't blame Apple for it. Would have been nice to
have figured this out earlier though, as it required a lot of intense reverse
engineering to unravel everything. Now it does work though, so totally worth
it! I have tried to document how it works on the protocols page:

https://pyatv.dev/documentation/protocols/

All needed to get things working again is to provide AirPlay credentials. One
important thing to note though is that you need to re-pair with this release
(or later) to get new credentials. The old ones will only work with `play_url`,
not for tunneling MRP over AirPlay. A small bonus here is that the HomePod
works in the same way as the Apple TV in this regards, so pyatv can now be used
to control HomdPods as well. No pairing is needed for that, it's just
plug-and-play!

Let's leave MRP now... My vision for pyatv is to create a "core", where
protocols work as plugins to provide functionality. The API used by developers
is supposed be towards core and not the protocols themselves. This basically
means that all functions in the API should behave in the same way, no matter
what protocols are used in regards to arguments, return values, listener
interfaces, error handling and so on. This release contains a lof of work
towards realizing that vision. I'm not quite there yet, but it's closer than
ever. Hopefully, this will only manifest itself through more consistent
behavior and not much you as a developer need to pay any attention to. But if
you notice any changes in behavior, this might be the reason. Be sure to report
anything that you find peculiar, it might need fixing or an explanation.

Another minor new feature is that the Audio interface has been extended to
include volume_up and volume_down, which also means those methods are
deprecated in `RemoteControl`. Please update your code for this. Also, all the
protocol specic service types, e.g. `conf.MrpService` and `conf.AirPlayService`
have been deprecated in favor of `conf.ManualService`. Update your code for
this as well, in case you rely on any of them. They will stick around for a few
releases, so your code won't break because of this. The last minor feature is a
helper method called `helpers.is_streamable`, which can check if file is
supported by `Stream.stream_file`.

One last thing... This release fills a big gap that has been present for a long
time: when do you need to pair? Each service now contains a "pairing" property
that will tell you of pairing is needed or not. This makes it possible to
programmatically determine if the pairing procedure needs to to performed,
something that wasn't clear before. After scanning, just iterate all services
and pair the ones requiring it. A similar property has been added for passwords
as well, called `requires_password`. If True, then a password is required to
connect. Only applicable to RAOP so far (it works for AirPlay as well, but
there's no support for passwords in AirPlay yet).

To round things up, I just wanted to say that docker images are automatically
built for new releases as well as the latest commit on master, making it easy
to test pyatv without having to install any additional software other than
docker. I still have some areas to improve, but it's a good start. This release
will be the first release having docker images pre-built as it's tricky to
backport.

That is it for now. Make sure to check out the migration guide to get some
hints on what you need to do when upgrading.

## 0.8.2 Helpy (2021-07-28)

Time for another minor release! Highlights this time is
improved scanning, password protected RAOP services, support
for HSCP and some remote buttons in Companion.

An issue hwere some devices were not discovered by Home Assistant
anymore suddenly appeared (pun intended). Some digging concluded
that asking for too many Zeroconf services in one request might
yield a response too big to fit in one IP packet. This makes the
sender silently drop records, rendering the response incomplete
without pyatv knowing that. Since Companion and RAOP was added in
0.8.0 (which require three new services in total), that was the
tipping point. From now on, pyatv will spread services over a few
requests to work around this issue.

It is now possible to stream audio to password protected AirPlay
receivers thanks to @Schlaubischlump! A password can be passed
to atvremote via `--raop-password` and it's explained how to do
it programmatically in the documentation.

HSCP (unsure what it stands for, maybe something like
*Home Sharing Control Protocol*?) is used to control instances of
iTunes or Music running on a Mac. Unfortunately, Apple decided
to require FairPlay authentication in macOS 11.4, so this will
only work if you are running an OS with lower version number than
that.

Some buttons in the remote control interface is now supported by
the Companion protocol. The API reference on
[pyatv.dev](https://pyatv.dev) actually lists which which protocols
implement a certain feature now, so it's recommended to look there
for current status.

There are a few house-keeping fixes in this release as well,
mostly related to tests, documentation and environment. A complete

## 0.8.1 Glitchtrap (2021-06-24)

This minor release contains a few improvements to the RAOP protocol.
First and foremost, `time.perf_counter` is now used in favor of
`time.monotonic` for audio scheduling. Scheduling has also been changed to work
with "global time" (from stream start) instead of per frame. These changes
improve streaming stability, with less chance of getting out of sync. They were
also necessary to get streaming working on Windows.

Another important addition in the streaming department is the ability to read
input from a FILE-like object, instead of just from a filename. One usecase for
this is to take input via stdin from another process and send it to a receiver.
`atvremote` has been adjusted to read from stdin if `-` is specified as
filename. Here's an example streaming output from ffmpeg (RTSP as input!):

```shell
ffmpeg -i rtsp://wowzaec2demo.streamlock.net/vod/mp4:BigBuckBunny_115k.mov -f mp3 - | atvremote -s 10.0.10.184 --debug stream_file=-
```

Documentation for this:

https://pyatv.dev/documentation/atvremote/#streaming
https://pyatv.dev/development/stream/#stream-a-file

**Changes:**

*Protocol: RAOP:*

```

```

## 0.8.0 Freddy (2021-06-17)

Here comes a new release, filled to the brim with new stuff! First and foremost, it
introduces support for not one but *two* new protocols: Companion and RAOP. The
Companion protocol is used to list and launch apps installed on an Apple TV as well
improving power management support. RAOP adds support for proper audio streaming
to AirPlay receivers. Both protocols are still early in development and may contains a
few bugs (yeah...). You will likely see new features added to these over time.

A big new change in this release, that isn't really noticeable at first, is a new layer
that relays calls between public interface methods and underlying protocols. What does
this mean then? Well, we have the public interfaces (Metadata, RemoteControl. etc.)
and the protocols implementing them (DMAP, MRP, RAOP, etc). Prior to this release,
DMAP and MRP would fully implement all of the interfaces (with a minor exception of
Stream) and there was a requirement to configure one of them. From now on however,
there's no such restriction as it's possible to connect to any number of protocols.
The Feature interface tells us what is actually supported. The new layer (internally
called *facade*) will automatically figure out which of the available protocol has the
most appropriate implementation and call that. If two protocols implement the same
interface method, there's mechanisms internally to pick the best one. An example is
the Power interface, where MRP and Companion both provide implementations for `turn_on`
and `turn_off`. If both these protocols are configured, then the implementations
provided by the Companion protocol will be used (as they are better), otherwise
fallback will happen to MRP.

From now on, the change log format changes a bit to list changes per protocol and
scripts. The goal is to make it easier to see what has changed or been fixed. This
release also introduces release names and all releases from now on will get a release
name based on characters from Five Nights Freddy's. First letter of the next release
name follows the letter of the previous one (the next release will be called
Glitchtrap for instance). Oh, and this release text is also new...

Other changes include a *big* overhaul of the documentation. A lot of things have
been improved and added, for instance a new tutorial and a few new examples. There's
a configuration for GitPod, so you can get going with pyatv development with a single
click!

Be sure to check out the migration notes before upgrading:

This change tries to make the AirPlay implementation look more like how it's done in the other protocols using SRP, e.g. MRP. It's a good start, but some additional work needs to be done regarding credentials parsing (but leaving that for the future).

## 0.7.6 (2021-01-29)

**Changes:**

* DNS parsing has been re-written which should be more stable
  and handle more use cases
* TCP keep-alive has been added to more platforms, FreeBSD being one of them
* Player management has been totally re-written for MRP, so hopefully
  play state should be more accurate now
* A delay has been added to turn\_off (MRP), so it should work again
* A heartbeat loop has been added that sends a "heartbeat" to the device
  every 30s to detect connection problems
* Protobuf definitions have been further lifted to match later tvOS versions

**Notes:**

* Fixed a bug where Playing instancess were not immutable
* Push updates are only issued when something in the Playing instance changed.
  Previously, unrelated changes to the device could trigger push updates with
  the same content in Playing.

## 0.7.0 (2020-07-14)

**Changes:**

* Input actions (single/double tap and hold) are now supported
* Support for aiohttp 4 (only tested with pre-release)
* Possibility to wait for power state change in turn_on and turn_off
* TCP keep-alive configured to detect stale connections
* Implement custom scanning (not using 3rd party zeroconf library)
* Switch back to zeroconf from aiozeroconf for service publishing
* Deep sleep detection when scanning
* Tunnel mode has been added to atvproxy
* A delay command has been added to atvremote
* Fix (potentially) for hanging connection after receiving artwork (MRP)
* Fix bug in device state when app reports invalid playback rate (MRP)
* Fix broken repeat handling (MRP)
* Fix broken pairing (DMAP)
* Fix missing application name (MRP)

**Notes:**

* This release contains re-written scanning logic which hopefully
  makes scanning more reliable (not 100% foolproof though). This
  re-write gives support for deep-sleep detection and better device
  model detection. It is however less tested, so bugs probably still
  exist. Please write bug reports.
* TCP keep-alive and timeout timers are now configured. Keep alive
  messages are sent regularly and the connection will time out (and
  disconnect) after 20 seconds of no replies.

## 0.5.0 (2020-03-19)

**Changes:**

* Add power interface
* Add device information interface
* Add playing app interface
* New scripts: atvscript and atvproxy
* External interface now has type hints
* Pure AirPlay devices are no longer returned by scan
* Files have been moved around and the public interface
  is now well-defined
* Documentation has moved to pyatv.dev

*Breaking Changes:*

* suspend and wakeup in the remote control interface are now
  deprecated. They did not work very well. Use the power interface
  instead.
* Black is now used for linting and black does not support
  python 3.5, so support for python 3.5 has been dropped.
* helpers.auto_connect is now a coroutine

**Notes:**

* Lots of updates to documentation and tests have been made
* An API reference is now available at pyatv.dev

## 0.4.0a13 (2020-01-31)

**Changes:**

* Fixed bug where device state would be reported as "paused"
  when playing (yielding incorrect position as side-effect). This
  also fixes delta updates, where metadata would sometimes be
  lost.
* Fixed bug where a crash would occur if a device had a = (0x3D)
  in its MAC-address
* Added artwork_id to metadata that gives a unique id for artwork
* Use cache for artwork that saves the latest four artworks
* Identifiers in config is now prioritized in order
  MRP, DMAP and AirPlay
* AirPlay is not handled specially in config now. If no AirPlay
  service is added, no service will be implicitly created.
* Error handling (raised exceptions) are now more consistent
  when pairing

*Breaking changes*

* AirPlay interface has been renamed to "stream", e.g. use
  atv.stream.play_url instead of atv.airplay.play_url.
