# CHANGES

## 0.7.0 (2020-07-14)

*Changes:*

* Input actions (single/double tap and hold) are now supported
* Support for aiohttp 4 (only tested with pre-release)
* Possibility to wait for power state change in turn_on and turn_off
* TCP keep-alive configured to detect stale connections
* Implement custom scanning (not using 3rd party zeroconf library)
* Switch back to zeroconf from aiozeroconf for service publishing
* Deep sleep detection when scanning
* Tunnel mode has been added to atvproxy
* A delay command has been added to atvremote
* Fix (potentially) for hanging connection after receiving artwork (MRP)
* Fix bug in device state when app reports invalid playback rate (MRP)
* Fix broken repeat handling (MRP)
* Fix broken pairing (DMAP)
* Fix missing application name (MRP)

*Notes:*

* This release contains re-written scanning logic which hopefully
  makes scanning more reliable (not 100% foolproof though). This
  re-write gives support for deep-sleep detection and better device
  model detection. It is however less tested, so bugs probably still
  exist. Please write bug reports.
* TCP keep-alive and timeout timers are now configured. Keep alive
  messages are sent regularly and the connection will time out (and
  disconnect) after 20 seconds of no replies.

## 0.5.0 (2020-03-19)

*Changes:*

* Add power interface
* Add device information interface

* External interface now has type hints
* Pure AirPlay devices are no longer returned by scan
* Files have been moved around and the public interface
  is now well-defined
* Documentation has moved to pyatv.dev

*Breaking Changes:*

* suspend and wakeup in the remote control interface are now
  deprecated. They did not work very well. Use the power interface
  instead.
* Black is now used for linting and black does not support
  python 3.5, so support for python 3.5 has been dropped.
* helpers.auto_connect is now a coroutine

*Notes:*

* Lots of updates to documentation and tests have been made
* An API reference is now available at pyatv.dev

*All changes:*

```

## 0.4.0a13 (2020-01-31)

*Changes:*

* Fixed bug where device state would be reported as "paused"
  when playing (yielding incorrect position as side-effect). This
  also fixes delta updates, where metadata would sometimes be
  lost.
* Fixed bug where a crash would occur if a device had a = (0x3D)
  in its MAC-address
* Added artwork_id to metadata that gives a unique id for artwork
* Use cache for artwork that saves the latest four artworks
* Identifiers in config is now prioritized in order
  MRP, DMAP and AirPlay
* AirPlay is not handled specially in config now. If no AirPlay
  service is added, no service will be implicitly created.
* Error handling (raised exceptions) are now more consistent
  when pairing

*Breaking changes*

* AirPlay interface has been renamed to "stream", e.g. use
  atv.stream.play_url instead of atv.airplay.play_url.

*Notes:*

* Running tests on Windows works again
* This release contains a lot new test coverage and all "common"
  functional tests have been ported to MRP
