    This is a convenience method that auto discovers devices, picks the first
    device found, connects to it and passes it to a user provided handler. An
    optional error handler can be provided that is called when no device was found.
    Very inflexible in many cases, but can be handys sometimes when trying things.

    Note: both handler and not_found must be coroutines
