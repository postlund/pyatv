# Acknowledgements

A *lot* of time and effort has been put into this project in order
to get where it is today. Some things I've done myself, but I could
of course not have done it all without help. So this page is a small
dedication the rest of you!

## External Projects

**[GitHub](https://github.com)**

Thanks for providing a good, integrated platform supporting free and
open source software. Since the launch of Pages and Actions I've
managed to move more or less completely to rely on GitHub services,
which is great!

**[mediaremotetv-protocol](https://github.com/jeanregisser/mediaremotetv-protocol)**

Thanks to Jean Regisser, which started exploring the Media Remote Protocol
and giving early insights. The `MRP` support is based on this findings.
It also helped me complete the reverse engineering of the protocol.
Some of my findings I have already submitted back.

**[pdoc3](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/)**

Every library needs an API reference. I use pdoc3 for that due to its
flexibility. With some tweaks it integrates neatly with the rest of the
documentation.

**[miniaudio](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio) / [pyminiaudio](https://github.com/irmen/pyminiaudio)**

Excellent minimalistic library for decoding and working with audio files! Supports
most relevant audio formats and operating systems. This library is vital
for audio streaming in RAOP (used via the python library).
