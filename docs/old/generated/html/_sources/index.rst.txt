Library Installation
--------------------

Use pip::

    $ pip install pyatv

NOTE: You need some system packages, run this on debian or similar:

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev

Getting Started
---------------

Connecting to the first automatically discovered device:

.. code:: python

    import asyncio
    from pyatv import helpers

    @asyncio.coroutine
    def print_what_is_playing(atv):
        playing = yield from atv.metadata.playing()
        print('Currently playing:')
        print(playing)

    helpers.auto_connect(print_what_is_playing)

Connecting to a specific device:

.. code:: python

    import pyatv
    import asyncio

    NAME = 'My Apple TV'
    ADDRESS = '10.0.10.22'
    LOGIN_ID = '00000000-1111-2222-3333-444444444444'
    DETAILS = pyatv.AppleTVDevice(NAME, ADDRESS, LOGIN_ID)


    @asyncio.coroutine
    def print_what_is_playing(loop, details):
        print('Connecting to {}'.format(details.address))
        atv = pyatv.connect_to_apple_tv(details, loop)

        try:
            playing = yield from atv.metadata.playing()
            print('Currently playing:')
            print(playing)
        except:
            yield from atv.logout()


    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(print_what_is_playing(loop, DETAILS))
