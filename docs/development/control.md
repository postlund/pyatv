# Control

Controlling a device is done with the remote control interface,
`interface.RemoteControl`. It allows you navigate the menus and
change playback (play, pause, etc.).

## Using the Remote Control API

After connecting to a device, you get the remote control via `remote_control`:

```python
atv = await pyatv.connect(config, ...)
rc = atv.remote_control
```

You can then control via the available functions:

```python
await rc.up()
await rc.select()
await rc.set_position(100)
```

All available actions can be found in `interface.RemoteControl`.
