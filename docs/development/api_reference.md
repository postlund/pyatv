# API Reference

At some point the API-reference will be listed here. In the meantime,
you can look at the source code of the modules:

| Filename | Content |
| -------- | ------- |
{% for file in page.files -%}
| [{{ file['name'] | replace: "__", "\_\_" }}]({{ "https://github.com/postlund/pyatv/blob/master/pyatv/" | append:file['name'] }}) | {{ file['description'] }} |
{% endfor- %}

The files above constitutes the public API. Any other file is to be considered
private and might change at any time with no further notice.
