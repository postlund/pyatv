# :tv: Main Page

This is an asyncio python library for interacting with Apple TV and AirPlay devices. It mainly
targets Apple TVs (all generations), but also support audio streaming via AirPlay to receivers like the HomePod,
AirPort Express and third-party speakers. It can act as remote control to the Music app/iTunes in macOS.

# :satisfied: Features

Here is a short summary of supported features:

* Automatic device discovery with Zeroconf
* Device information, e.g. hardware model and operating system version
* Currently playing metadata, artwork and push updates
* Remote, navigation and volume control commands
* Basic support for streaming video and audio with AirPlay
* Listing installed apps, launching apps and currently playing app
* Power management, e.g. turn on or off
* Supports Apple TV (all of them), AirPort Express, HomePod, macOS music app and most AirPlay v1 receivers
* Persistent storage of credentials and settings, e.g. to file or custom built storage

A complete list of supported features and limitations is available
[here](documentation/supported_features).

There are also few utility scripts bundled with pyatv that makes it easy to try the library
out. Check out [atvremote](documentation/atvremote), [atvproxy](documentation/atvproxy),
[atvscript](documentation/atvscript) and [atvlog](documentation/atvlog).

# :eyes: Where to start?

To get going, install with `pip`:

<div class="center_box" style="margin-bottom: 2em">
  <p style="margin: 0px">:tada: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyatv">pip install pyatv :tada:</a></p>
</div>

Head over to [Getting started](documentation/getting-started) to see what you can do! There's
also a [Tutorial](documentation/tutorial) if you want to get going faster!

As pyatv is a library, it is mainly aimed for developers creating applications that can interact
with Apple TVs. However, pyatv ships with a few powerful command lines tools you can use to
try the library without writing any code.

If you need help or have questions, check out the [Support](support) page instead.

In case you are upgrading from an earlier version of pyatv, make sure to check out the migration
guide [here](support/migration) that will help you port your existing code.

# :cloud: In other the news...

As pyatv depends solely on private and reverse engineered protocols, things sometimes break because
Apple changes something. Or because of other reasons. This section covers the major things that you
need to be aware of.

* As of tvOS 15, the Media Remote Protocol (MRP) is tunneled over AirPlay 2. Support for this was
  introduced in version 0.9.0 of pyatv, so be sure to use a later version than that.
* Support for {% include api i="interface.Stream.play_url" %} on tvOS was restored in version 0.13.3.
* It is possible to control the Music app running on a Mac, but macOS 11.4 seems to not work.
* If you have problems with {% include pypi package="miniaudio" %} on ARM (e.g. Rasperry Pi), try
  re-installing {% include pypi package="miniaudio" %} and building it from source. See [here](support/faq#when-using-pyatv-on-a-raspberry-pi-eg-running-atvremote-i-get-illegal-instruction-how-do-i-fix-that)
  for details.
* Other general issues can be found in the [FAQ](support/faq).
