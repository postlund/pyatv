class SemiSeekableBuffer:
    """Implementation of a "semi-seekable" buffer.

    A semi-seekable buffer in this context is a buffer that allows seeking, but with
    restrictions. The buffer shall be thought of more like a stream, where data is read
    in a stream like fashion but added similarly to like a buffer. The buffer has a
    fixed size internally, but an absolute "position" is maintained based on all data
    read from the buffer.

    To allow seeking, a "headroom" (with adjustable size) is kept in the beginning of
    the buffer. Data in the headroom is kept (internally) until the last byte of the
    headroom is read, after which is discarded from the internal buffer (and new data
    can be added again, in case buffer was full). As long as headroom is available,
    seeking is possible. But once it has been discarded, it is not. In analogy to a
    stream, this basically means the first X bytes of the stream is buffered and
    seekable until all X bytes have been read completely.

    The purpose of this kind of buffer is to support data streams (e.g. audio files)
    containing non-linear header data. Some file formats require "looking ahead" in the
    data stream to figure out the structure, thus seeking is needed to reset to
    beginning of the file. This is not a foolproof solution, but this allows for far
    better support in these cases.

    A special feature called "protected headroom" is also implemented. When enabled,
    the buffer acts as usual but the entire buffer is treated like headroom and no
    data is ever removed. This is particularly useful when reading metadata with one
    library (e.g. Mediafile) while decoding actual data with another library (e.g.
    miniaudio). In a non-seekable stream, the first library would consume data required
    by the second library. So you would get either metadata or audio data - but not
    both. By protecting the headroom, Mediafile can read data (and seek) as much as it
    wants, but it will always be possible to seek to the beginning again and remove
    the protection before passing buffer to miniaudio, thus allowing both metadata and
    audio data to be extracted properly.

    Protected headroom can only be enabled/disabled when position is 0, i.e. it
    cannot be enabled if data has been read nor can it be disabled before seeking to
    the beginning again.
